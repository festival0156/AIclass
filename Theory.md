What is Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?
An artificial neural network is the piece of computing system designed to stimulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the foundation of AI and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards. ANNs have self learning capabilities that enable them to produce better results as more data becomes available.

What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognise relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way a human brain operates. In this sense, neural network refers to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

* Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.
* They are used in a variety of applications in financial services, from forecasting and marketing research to fraud detection and risk assessment.
* Use of neural networks for stock market price prediction varies.
